# Supplementary lints

Like the [general-purpose lints], the supplementary lints use `dylint_linting`'s [`constituent` feature].

See the general-purpose lints' [documentation] for an explanation.

[`constituent` feature]: ../../utils/linting/README.md#constituent-feature
[documentation]: ../general/README.md
[general-purpose lints]: ../general
