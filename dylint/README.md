# Dylint

Run Rust lints from dynamic libraries

```sh
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
```

Dylint is a Rust linting tool, similar to Clippy. But whereas Clippy runs a predetermined, static set of lints, Dylint runs lints from user-specified, dynamic libraries. Thus, Dylint allows developers to maintain their own personal lint collections.

## Quick start

### Running Dylint

The next two steps install Dylint and run all of this repository's [general-purpose, example lints] on a workspace:

1. Install `cargo-dylint` and `dylint-link`:

   ```sh
   cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link
   ```

2. Run `cargo-dylint`:
   ```sh
   cargo dylint --git https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint --pattern examples/general
   ```

In the above example, the libraries are found via the command line. If you plan to run Dylint regularly, then consider using [workspace metadata]. For additional ways of finding libraries, see [How Dylint works].

### Writing lints

You can start writing your own Dylint library by running `cargo dylint new new_lint_name`. Doing so will produce a loadable library right out of the box. You can verify this as follows:

```sh
cargo dylint new new_lint_name
cd new_lint_name
cargo build
cargo dylint list --path .
```

All you have to do is implement the [`LateLintPass`] trait and accommodate the symbols asking to be filled in.

Helpful [resources] for writing lints appear below.

## Features

### Workspace metadata

A workspace can name the libraries it should be linted with in its `Cargo.toml` or `dylint.toml` file. Specifically, either file can contain a TOML array under `workspace.metadata.dylint.libraries`. Each array entry must have the form of a Cargo `git` or `path` dependency, with the following differences:

- There is no leading package name, i.e., no `package =`.
- `path` entries can contain [glob] patterns, e.g., `*`.
- Any entry can contain a `pattern` field whose value is a [glob] pattern. The `pattern` field indicates the subdirectories that contain Dylint libraries.

Dylint downloads and builds each entry, similar to how Cargo downloads and builds a dependency. The resulting `target/release` directories are searched for files with names of the form that Dylint recognizes (see [Library requirements] under [How Dylint works]).

As an example, if you include the following in your workspace's `Cargo.toml` or `dylint.toml` file and run `cargo dylint --all`, Dylint will run all of this repository's [example general-purpose lints], as well as the example restriction lint [`try_io_result`].

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
    { git = "https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint", pattern = "examples/general" },
    { git = "https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint", pattern = "examples/restriction/try_io_result" },
]
```

For convenience, the `pattern` field can contain an array, in which case the pattern is considered to be the union of the array elements. Thus, the just given `workspace.metadata.dylint.libraries` example could alternatively be written as:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.dylint]
libraries = [
    { git = "https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint", pattern = [
        "examples/general",
        "examples/restriction/try_io_result",
    ] },
]
```

### Configurable libraries

Libraries can be configured by including a `dylint.toml` file in a linted workspace's root directory. The file should encode a [toml table] whose keys are library names. A library determines how its value in the table (if any) is interpreted.

As an example, a `dylint.toml` file with the following contents sets the [`non_local_effect_before_error_return`] library's `work_limit` configuration to `1_000_000`:

```toml
[non_local_effect_before_error_return]
work_limit = 1_000_000
```

For instructions on creating a configurable library, see the [`dylint_linting`] documentation.

### Conditional compilation

For each library that Dylint uses to check a crate, Dylint passes the following to the Rust compiler:

```sh
--cfg=dylint_lib="LIBRARY_NAME"
```

You can use this feature to allow a lint when Dylint is used, but also avoid an "unknown lint" warning when Dylint is not used. Specifically, you can do the following:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(dylint_lib = "LIBRARY_NAME", allow(LINT_NAME))]
```

Note that `LIBRARY_NAME` and `LINT_NAME` may be the same. For an example involving [`non_thread_safe_call_in_test`], see [dylint/src/lib.rs] in this repository.

Also note that the just described approach does not work for pre-expansion lints. The only known workaround for pre-expansion lints is allow the compiler's built-in [`unknown_lints`] lint. Specifically, you can do the following:

```rust
#[allow(unknown_lints)]
#[allow(PRE_EXPANSION_LINT_NAME)]
```

For an example involving [`abs_home_path`], see [internal/src/examples.rs] in this repository.

#### Rustc's `unexpected_cfg` lint

As of nightly-2024-05-05, the names and values of every reachable `#[cfg]` [are checked]. This causes the compiler to produce warnings for `cfg_attr` attributes as described above.

To suppress such warnings, add the following to your packages' Cargo.toml files:

```toml
[lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs]
level = "warn"
check-cfg = ["cfg(dylint_lib, values(any()))"]
```

Or, if you're using a Cargo workspace, add the following the workspace's Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[workspace.lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs]
level = "warn"
check-cfg = ["cfg(dylint_lib, values(any()))"]
```

Then, add the following to the Cargo.toml file of each package in the workspace:

```toml
[lints]
workspace = true
```

For an example, see commit [`c8fabc5`] in this repository.

### VS Code integration

Dylint results can be viewed in VS Code using [rust-analyzer]. To do so, add the following to your VS Code `settings.json` file:

```json
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.overrideCommand": [
        "cargo",
        "dylint",
        "--all",
        "--",
        "--all-targets",
        "--message-format=json"
    ]
```

If you want to use rust-analyzer inside a lint library, you need to add the following to your VS Code `settings.json` file:

```json
    "rust-analyzer.rustc.source": "discover",
```

And add the following to the library's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package.metadata.rust-analyzer]
rustc_private = true
```

## Utilities

The following utilities can be helpful for writing Dylint libraries:

- [`dylint-link`] is a wrapper around Rust's default linker (`cc`) that creates a copy of your library with a filename that Dylint recognizes.
- [`dylint_library!`] is a macro that automatically defines the `dylint_version` function and adds the `extern crate rustc_driver` declaration.
- [`ui_test`] is a function that can be used to test Dylint libraries. It provides convenient access to the [`compiletest_rs`] package.
- [`clippy_utils`] is a collection of utilities to make writing lints easier. It is generously made public by the Rust Clippy Developers. Note that, like `rustc`, `clippy_utils` provides no stability guarantees for its APIs.

## MSRV policy

A bump of the Dylint library's MSRV will be accompanied by a bump of at least Dylint's minor version.

Put another way, we strive to preserve Dylint's MSRV when releasing bug fixes, and to change it only when releasing new features.
