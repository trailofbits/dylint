# Experimental Dylint tab-completion support for Bash
#
# This file works by "patching" cargo completions. Its effect is, e.g., that typing:
# ```
# cargo dylint --lib <tab>
# ```
# suggests the libraries that Dylint can find, i.e., those produced by `cargo dylint --list`.
#
# To use this file:
#
# First, install cargo completions. Details for doing so are given by:
# ```
# rustup completions --help
# ```
# Second, copy this file to somewhere in your home directory, e.g.:
# ```
# cp completions/dylint ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/dylint
# ```
# Finally, in your `.bashrc` file, source this file **after** you source the cargo completions
# script produced by rustup. For example, your `.bashrc` file might look something like this:
# ```
# source "$HOME/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/cargo"
# source "$HOME/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/dylint"
# ```
