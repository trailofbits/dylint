name: Update dependencies

# smoelius: Every Monday at 3:00 UTC (Sunday at 22:00 EST), create a PR to update dependencies to
# their latest patch versions.
#
# The main purpose of this action is verify that the project's lockfiles aren't needed to build it
# (hence, the `rm -f Cargo.lock` below). However, doing so produces up-to-date lockfiles as a
# by-product. From there, `cargo upgrade` can be used to make the `Cargo.toml` files match. So,
# given that we have these up-to-date `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml` files, why not create a PR?
