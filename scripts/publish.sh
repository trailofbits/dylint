# smoelius: I have been getting messages like the following from `cargo publish` in cases where the
# matching package was just published:
#
#   error: failed to prepare local package for uploading
#
#   Caused by:
#     no matching package named `dylint` found
#     location searched: registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
#
# My current method for checking whether a package is ready to be depended upon is to create a
# temporary package with one dependency (the matching package) and to run `cargo check` on it.
#
# This solution is less than ideal because, e.g., `cargo check` could fail for reasons other than
# the package being unavailable. But every other approach I've tried has definitely *not* worked,
# including checking `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates` with curl.
#
# The ideal solution would likely be to check `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`. But
# the index's structure is not obvious, nor is how one would check it from the command line. This
# should be investigated further.
